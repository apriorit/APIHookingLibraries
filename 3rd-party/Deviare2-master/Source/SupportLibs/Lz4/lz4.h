LZ4_compress() :

		To avoid any problem, size it to handle worst cases situations (input data not compressible)
		Worst case size is : "inputsize + 0.4%", with "0.4%" being at least 8 bytes.

LZ4_uncompress() :
	osize  : is the output size, therefore the original size
	return : the number of bytes read in the source buffer
			 If the source stream is malformed, the function will stop decoding and return a negative result, indicating the byte position of the faulty instruction
			 This version never writes beyond dest + osize, and is therefore protected against malicious data packets

int LZ4_compressCtx(void** ctx, char* source,  char* dest, int isize);

/*
LZ4_compressCtx() :
	This function explicitly handles the CTX memory structure.
	It avoids allocating/deallocating memory between each call, improving performance when malloc is time-consuming.
	Note : when memory is allocated into the stack (default mode), there is no "malloc" penalty.
	Therefore, this function is mostly useful when memory is allocated into the heap (it requires increasing HASH_LOG value beyond STACK_LIMIT)

	On first call : provide a *ctx=NULL; It will be automatically allocated.
	On next calls : reuse the same ctx pointer.
	Use different pointers for different threads when doing multi-threading.

	note : performance difference is small, mostly noticeable in HeapMode when repetitively calling the compression function over many small segments.
