# Introduction
This library was created as a free alternative to [Microsoft Detours](http://research.microsoft.com/sn/detours). It is originally developed by Marton Anka and currently is supported and developed by [Apriorit](https://www.apriorit.com/).

# How to use
```C++
// Include a header
#include <mhook-lib/mhook.h>

// Save the original function
typedef ULONG (WINAPI* _NtClose)(IN HANDLE Handle);
_NtClose TrueNtClose = (_NtClose)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(L"ntdll"), "NtClose");

// Declare your function that will be handle a hook:
ULONG WINAPI HookNtClose(HANDLE hHandle) 
{
    printf("***** Call to NtClose(0x%p)\n", hHandle);
    return TrueNtClose(hHandle);
}

//...

// Set the hook 
BOOL isHookSet = Mhook_SetHook((PVOID*)&TrueNtClose, HookNtClose);

//...

// After finishing using the hook â€“ remove it
Mhook_Unhook((PVOID*)&TrueNtClose);

```

You can also set a bunch of hooks in one call:
```C++
HOOK_INFO hooks[] =
{
    { (PVOID*)&TrueNtOpenProcess, HookNtOpenProcess },
    { (PVOID*)&TrueSelectObject, HookSelectobject },
    { (PVOID*)&Truegetaddrinfo, Hookgetaddrinfo },
    { (PVOID*)&TrueHeapAlloc, HookHeapAlloc },
    { (PVOID*)&TrueNtClose, HookNtClose }
};

int numberOfSetHooks = Mhook_SetHookEx(hooks, 5);
    
//...

// Removing hooks
int numberOfRemovedHooks = Mhook_UnhookEx(hooks, 5);
```

That way of setting multiple hooks is also much better in performance.

# Acknowledgements
Mhook contains a disassembler that is a stripped-down version of the excellent tDisasm package by Matt Conover. Thank you Matt! tDisasm comes with a BSD-style license and re-releasig a derivative of it under the MIT license has been confirmed to be OK by its author. 

Alexandr Filenkov submitted bugfixes in Sept-2007. Michael Syrovatsky submitted fixes for IP-relative addressing in Jun-2008. Andrey Kubyshev submitted a bugfix in Jul-2011 and Jan-2013. John McDonald enabled unlimited hooks. Kasper Brandt provided a fix for hot patch function prologues.
